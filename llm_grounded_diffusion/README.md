<h1>LLM-grounded Diffusion: Enhancing Prompt Understanding of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Large Language Models</h1>
<h2>LLM + Stable Diffusion => better prompt understanding in text2image generation ðŸ¤©</h2>

<p><b>Tips:</b><p>
<p>1. If ChatGPT doesn't generate layout, add/remove the trailing space (added by default) and/or use GPT-4.</p>
<p>2. You can perform multi-round specification by giving ChatGPT follow-up requests (e.g., make the object boxes bigger).</p>
<p>3. You can also try prompts in Simplified Chinese. If you want to try prompts in another language, translate the first line of last example to your language.</p>
<p>4. The diffusion model only runs 20 steps by default. You can make it run 50 steps to get higher quality images (or tweak frozen steps/guidance steps for better guidance and coherence).</p>
<br/>
<p>Implementation note: In this demo, we replace the attention manipulation in our layout-guided Stable Diffusion described in our paper with GLIGEN due to much faster inference speed (<b>FlashAttention supported, no backprop needed</b> during inference). Compared to vanilla GLIGEN, we have better coherence. Other parts of text-to-image pipeline, including single object generation and SAM, remain the same. The settings and examples in the prompt are simplified in this demo.</p>
